# Duplicate-Files-Grouper
Look for files that are copies or has the same name but different extensions and groups them by creating a new directory. 

## Background:  
This piece of code is very dear to me, as it is my very first code of my own creation. I created this code back in 2019 after learning to code from a few YouTube and online sources. This was the very first time I touch actual "coding" and fell in love with the process of frustration, confusion and satisfaction when my code actually started working.

The idea for this code come about during my internship. I was tasked to sort a bunch of documents and excel files and group them by creating a folder with the same name. The documents and their associating excel files are correlated by the name of the files. There are also the occasional copies which I was told to be place in the files as well.

## Instructions:  
1) Place duplicate/copy of files in the folder called `"File to work on"`. Recommend you create a copy of your files before putting them into the folder "File to work on".

2) Run the `DuplicateFilesGrouper.py` script with either an IDE or using cmd directly with the command  
```
python "File Manager Program.py"
```

3) Your duplicate files should be grouped at this point.
